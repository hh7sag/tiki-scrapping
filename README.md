# tiki-scrapping
Tiki scrapping is a project which I use Selenium Web Driver to extract all information of products from the Tiki website and synthesize as a .csv file (similar to the Excel file). This project is done in Google Colaboratory Notebook using Python language

## **Overview**

Tiki is considered as one of the top 4 ecommerce platforms with high number of customers in Vietnam, along with Shopee, Lazada and Sendo. Founded in 2010, Tiki has always strived to improve product quality as well as service with a view to optimizing customer experience while shopping with fast delivery in 2 hours.
Tiki has 3 subsidiaries including Tiki Corporation, Tiki Smart Logistics and Tiki Trading which all support Tiki operations to support customers from product segmentation to final delivery and post-purchase activities from customers

## **Problem Statement**

When I buy things at any ecommerce platform such as Tiki, I have to scroll page by page and click any product and check the name, price, image, thumbnail, ratings and so on. The fact that you have to scroll page by page is time-consuming. So I am thinking how about scrapping product information all at once and size them up as a Excel file (.csv) file to check the information easier.
